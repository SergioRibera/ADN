> [!WARNING]
> This project seeks the contribution of more people in order to have a lot of support for different languages with working configurations.

## Installation

It is very simple, you just need to have `cargo` installed on your computer.

```sh
cargo install adn
```

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure you have `~/.cargo/bin` in your PATH to be able to use the `adn` command.

## How to use

```sh
adn ACTION LANGUAGE
```

| Arg      | Description                                                                                  |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ACTION   | In this part we will put the action that we want to do `i` to install or (`r` to remove WIP) |
| LANGUAGE | Here we will put the name of the language we want the LSP to be installed in.                |

> [!NOTE]
> If the `path` does not end in `langugages.toml` it will throw an error.

### Example

You can run the command from helix using `:run-command-shell` or if you prefer in your trusted terminal.

```sh
adn i rust
```
